Till now I just applied the first working part of the project. While I still stuck in the interpretation of the matrix as result, i realized that the vertical fields give the true-true value back. Usually horizontal datasets/instance/rows would explain each possible expected (predefined result). That means the other vertical collums defined true-false or false-false. Than the explanation would be, just one not right matched learning result through this algorithm for me is already a dame good result. 

Who can review my interpretation?
 
To learn more on the influence factors for such great results, I am looking at entropy calculations (quality of the training data). 
May one of you has great exercise examples for  H= -Î£i-m (pi log(2)pi)
